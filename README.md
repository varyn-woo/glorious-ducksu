# Glorious Ducksu Frontend
This repo contains all of the frontend code for the Glorious Ducksu local gaming server.

## Dependencies
To run this, you need to set up:
- [Node/NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation)
- [Gojo](https://github.com/varyn-woo/gojo) (Go server side of this project)

## Viewing the Site
To run the website, `cd` into the directory and run `npm run dev`. Then, go to `localhost:3000` to view the current version of the site. This will live update as you edit the code and save your changes.


The site will not function properly unless the Gojo server is also running. See the [README](https://github.com/varyn-woo/gojo/blob/main/README.md) for instructions on how to set it up and get it running.
